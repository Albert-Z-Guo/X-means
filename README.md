# X-means
This repository contains a modern implementation of a 2000 [ICML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Machine_Learning) paper [X-means: Extending K-means with Efficient Estimation of the Number of Clusters](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645529.657808).

For more derivation details, the [notes](https://github.com/bobhancock/goxmeans/blob/master/doc/BIC_notes.pdf) written by [Robert Hancock](https://github.com/bobhancock) provide great insights on how Bayesian information criteria (BIC) are calculated under identical spherical normal distribution for each cluster. A version with correction is also attached in `references` directory.

The current implementation also provides a more computationally intensive option to calculate BIC scores directly (through explicit log likelihood computation) without any distribution assumptions (e.g. identical spherical normal); as well as additional options to choose subclusters' centers manually by splitting parent cluster's center along the longest vector (or along a random vector as mentioned in the paper) from cluster's center in opposite directions, or to choose subclusters's centers using [k-means++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B) initialization.
