# X-means
This repository contains a modern implementation of a 2000 [ICML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Machine_Learning) paper [X-means: Extending K-means with Efficient Estimation of the Number of Clusters](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645529.657808).

For more derivation details, the [notes](https://github.com/bobhancock/goxmeans/blob/master/doc/BIC_notes.pdf) written by [Robert Hancock](https://github.com/bobhancock) provide great insights on how Bayesian information criteria are calculated under identical spherical Gaussian distribution for each cluster. A version with correction is also attached in `references` directory.

The current implementation also provides a more computationally intensive option to calculate BIC scores directly (through explicit log likelihood computation) without any distribution assumption, as well as option to choose subclusters' centers manually by splitting parent cluster's center along random or along the longest radius in opposite directions as mentioned in the paper; or to choose subclusters's centers using [k-means++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B) initialization.
